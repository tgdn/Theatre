# Theatre

:zap: An __application__ that lets you decide the next *__movie__* :movie_camera: to watch on your computer. :zap:

> __Theatre__ scans your folders to find movies you have on your disk(s).
> It then displays them with information about each so you can select the correct one for your movie night.

Built with :heart: using [Atom's Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) (Atom Shell) and a bunch of open source projects :octocat:
